## Introduction

In this repository, I aim to explore the fascinating field of deep learning. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks to learn and make predictions from complex data. By leveraging deep neural networks, we can tackle a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects and resources in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies and libraries specified in the project's documentation.
3. Explore the different folders and files to find the specific project or resource you are interested in.
4. Follow the instructions provided in each project's README file to run the code or reproduce the results.

## Projects

This repository contains the following deep learning projects:

1. Project 1: [Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks](./projects/image_classification)
2. Project 2: [Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks](./projects/sentiment_analysis)
3. Project 3: [Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Synthesis](./projects/gan)

Feel free to explore each project's folder to learn more about the implementation details, datasets used, and results obtained.
